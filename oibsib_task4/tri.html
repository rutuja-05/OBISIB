            <p class="About">

                Steven Paul Jobs (/dʒɒbz/; February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate,
                industrial designer, investor, and media proprietor. He was the chairman, chief executive officer (CEO),
                and co-founder of Apple Inc.; the chairman and majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt
                Disney Company's board of directors following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and
                CEO of NeXT. Jobs is widely recognized as a pioneer of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and
                1980s, along with his early business partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.<br>

                Jobs and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the duo
                gained fame and wealth a year later with the Apple II, one of the first highly successful mass-produced
                microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and
                had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in
                1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI.<br>
                The Macintosh introduced the desktop publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter,
                the first laser printer to feature vector graphics. Jobs was forced out of Apple in 1985 after a long
                power struggle with the company's board and its then-CEO John Sculley. That same year, Jobs took a few
                Apple employees with him to found NeXT, a computer platform development company that specialized in
                computers for higher-education and business markets.<br>
                In addition, he helped to develop the visual effects industry when he funded the computer graphics division of George Lucas's Lucasfilm in 1986. The new company was Pixar, which produced the first 3D computer animated feature film Toy Story (1995), and went on to become a major animation studio, producing over 20 films since then.

            <p class="para">
                Jobs became CEO of Apple in 1997, following his company's acquisition of NeXT. He was largely
                responsible for helping revive Apple, which had been on the verge of bankruptcy. He worked closely with
                designer Jony Ive to develop a line of products that had larger cultural ramifications, beginning in
                1997 with the "Think different" advertising campaign and leading to the iMac, iTunes, iTunes Store,
                Apple Store, iPod, iPhone, App Store, and the iPad. In 2001, the original Mac OS was replaced with the
                completely new Mac OS X (now known as macOS), based on NeXT's platform, giving the OS a modern
                Unix-based foundation for the first time. Jobs was diagnosed with a pancreatic neuroendocrine tumor in
                2003. He died of respiratory arrest related to the tumor at age 56 on October 5, 2011.<br>

                According to Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, "Steve didn't ever code. He wasn't an engineer and he
                didn't do any original design.. Daniel Kottke, one of Apple's earliest employees and a college friend of
                Jobs's, stated: "Between Woz and Jobs, Woz was the innovator, the inventor. Steve Jobs was the marketing
                person.<br>

                He is listed as either primary inventor or co-inventor in 346 United States patents or patent
                applications related to a range of technologies from actual computer and portable devices to user
                interfaces (including touch-based), speakers, keyboards, power adapters, staircases, clasps, sleeves,
                lanyards and packages. Jobs's contributions to most of his patents were to "the look and feel of the
                product". His industrial design chief Jonathan Ive had his name along with Jobs's name for 200 of the
                patents Most of these are design patents (specific product designs; for example, Jobs listed as primary
                inventor in patents for both original and lamp-style iMacs, as well as PowerBook G4 Titanium) as opposed
                to utility patents (inventions). He has 43 issued US patents on inventions. The patent on the Mac OS X
                Dock user interface with "magnification" feature was issued the day before he died. Although Jobs had
                little involvement in the engineering and technical side of the original Apple computers, Jobs later
                used his CEO position to directly involve himself with product design.<br>
